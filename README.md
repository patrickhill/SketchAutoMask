# Sketch Auto Mask

Auto Mask is a Sketch plugin that masks a selected layer or group. It's unique from the Sketch's built in mask tool becaues it sets the mask bounds to the same dimensions as the layer being masked giving you full control over how you want the mask to fit. It also comes with a handy shortcut: cmd + shft + m.
